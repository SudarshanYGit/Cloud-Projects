REAL-LIFE AWS PROJECT
AWS EC2 Cost Estimation using Python
Built a Python-based AWS EC2 cost estimation tool using boto3 to fetch real-time instance metadata and calculate actual running and projected monthly costs. Implemented IAM-based secure access and followed AWS cost-optimization best practices by terminating unused resources.

Key Features
Uses a real EC2 instance
Calculates hourly, running, and monthly cost
Secure access using IAM
Free-tier safe implementation

Tools & Technologies
AWS EC2
AWS IAM
Python
boto3
AWS CLI

Outcome
The project successfully demonstrated real-world cloud cost estimation and best practices for cost optimization by terminating unused EC2 resources.
